# fast-neural-style
This repo is modified from [pytorch sample](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style)

This repository contains a pytorch implementation of an algorithm for artistic style transfer. The algorithm can be used to mix the content of an image with the style of another image. For example, here is a photograph of a door arch rendered in the style of a stained glass painting.

The model uses the method described in [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) along with [Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf).
